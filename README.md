# GoogleBenchmarkTests
A collection of performance benchmarks and microbenchmarks using the Google Benchmark library for C++.   
This repository provides examples, test cases, and performance comparisons to measure execution time, memory usage, and algorithm efficiency, helping developers identify bottlenecks and optimise their C++ code.

## Features
Ready-to-run microbenchmarks for common algorithms and data structures.  
Demonstrations of best practices for writing accurate and reliable benchmarks.  
Comparative performance analysis for different coding approaches.    
Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated performance testing.  

## Compilation Instructions 
```
g++ comparison_shared_vs_regular_mutex_googlebechmark.cpp -O3 -lbenchmark -lpthread -o comparison_shared_vs_regular_mutex_googlebechmark  
```
